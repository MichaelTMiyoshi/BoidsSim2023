# BoidsSim2023
 
This version of Boids was created in Unity a couple years ago.  But there was something wrong when I cloned the old project.  So I tried it again.  This time, I made sure that I used the .gitignore file that I have used with other Unity projects that does not have too much stuff in it.  (I have not yet tested to make sure that it gets cloned properly to a different computer.)

A couple things.

I used the blank project as a starting point.  Then, I copied over all the assets into the project.  I decided that I wanted to rename the project too so I renamed the folder.  Then, I deleted the visual studio .sln file.  When I opened the copied project in Unity, it made a new .sln file with the project name.  This was a nice piece of new knowledge.  I figured renaming the .sln file would cause problems, so I did not want to try that.  Turns out that Unity is pretty sharp that way.

There were two things that I had to do to make the project work.  I forget exactly what the first problem was.

The second problem was that the toggles did not work.  I fixed that after watching this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4S_zl9XFcxA).
